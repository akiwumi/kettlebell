# AI Assistant – Quick start (user guide)

## What is it?

The **AI Assistant** gives you short, personalized insights based on the data you already enter in the app: workouts, body metrics, schedule, and profile. Everything is computed on your device; nothing is sent to the cloud.

## How to open it

1. **From Home** – Scroll to “Your dashboard” and tap the **AI insights** card (🤖).
2. **From the menu** – Tap the **Menu** (☰) icon in the bottom bar, then **🤖 AI Assistant**.

## What you’ll see

- A short explanation that insights are generated locally.
- A **Refresh insights** button to recompute after you add new data.
- **Six insight cards:**
  - Workout consistency  
  - Volume trend  
  - Goal progress  
  - Streak & adherence  
  - Exercise variety  
  - Next best action  

Some cards include a suggested action (e.g. “Log body metrics” or “Start a session”) that links to the right screen.

## Getting better insights

- **Log workouts** – Especially with exercises, sets, reps, and weight so volume and variety can be analyzed.
- **Set a target weight** in Profile and **log body metrics** so goal progress and next actions make sense.
- **Set your training days per week** in Profile so adherence is meaningful.
- **Use the Schedule** and reminders so “next best action” can suggest turning on reminders if they’re off.

## Privacy

All analysis runs in your browser. No data is sent to any server. Refreshing the page or tapping “Refresh insights” only recomputes from your local data.
