# Always update the README

Whenever you change the kettlebell-app codebase (features, components, routes, libs, config, or behaviour), update **README.md** in the same change set.

1. **Changelog** – Add a new row to the **Changelog / updates** table (near the top) describing what changed. Put the latest change in the first data row.

2. **Affected sections** – Update any sections that are no longer accurate:
   - Routes and page components
   - Layout / Shared UI / Data components
   - Features (e.g. Landing, Home, Timer setup, Session, Profile)
   - Data, lib, and services
   - Public assets
   - Full file tree (new or removed files)
   - Development notes

3. The README is the project’s **up-to-date reference**; keep it accurate so structure and behaviour stay documented.
