## 1 · HINGE (7 Exercises)

### 1.1 Two-Hand Swing

**Definition:** The foundational kettlebell movement. Standing with feet shoulder-width apart, the athlete hinges at the hips, grips the kettlebell handle with both hands, and drives the bell forward and upward to chest height using an explosive hip snap — not arm strength. The bell floats momentarily at the top before swinging back between the legs in a pendulum arc.

**Video Prompt:**
> A fit athlete in a gym performs a two-hand kettlebell swing. Camera is at a ¾ front angle, full-body framing. The athlete stands with feet shoulder-width apart, hinges at the hips to swing a kettlebell back between the legs, then explosively drives the hips forward to propel the bell up to chest height with straight arms. The bell floats briefly at the top and swings back down into the next rep. Smooth, continuous motion. Clean gym background, even lighting. Seamless loop. 4 seconds, one full repetition.

---

### 1.2 One-Hand Swing

**Definition:** Identical mechanics to the two-hand swing, but performed gripping the handle with a single hand. This demands greater grip strength, anti-rotation core engagement, and shoulder stability as the body resists twisting under the asymmetric load.

**Video Prompt:**
> A fit athlete performs a one-hand kettlebell swing with their right hand. ¾ front-angle camera, full-body shot. The athlete hinges at the hips, swings the kettlebell back between the legs with one arm, and drives the hips forward to float the bell to chest height. The free arm moves naturally for balance. The torso stays square with no rotation. Smooth continuous loop. Clean studio background, even lighting. 4 seconds, one full rep.

---

### 1.3 Two-Hand Deadlift

**Definition:** A controlled hip-hinge lift. The kettlebell sits on the floor between the feet. The athlete hinges at the hips with a flat back, grips the handle with both hands, and stands up tall by driving through the heels and extending the hips. The bell is then lowered back to the floor with the same controlled hinge. No swing or momentum involved.

**Video Prompt:**
> A fit athlete performs a two-hand kettlebell deadlift. Side-angle camera, full-body framing. The kettlebell rests on the floor between the athlete's feet. They hinge at the hips with a flat back, grip the handle with both hands, and stand tall by driving through the heels. They pause briefly at the top with hips fully extended, then slowly hinge back down to place the bell on the floor. Controlled, slow tempo. Clean gym background, even lighting. Seamless loop. 5 seconds, one full rep.

---

### 1.4 One-Hand Deadlift

**Definition:** A single-arm variation of the kettlebell deadlift. The athlete hinges to grip the bell with one hand while the free arm stays out for balance. This variation introduces an anti-rotation demand on the core and challenges grip strength unilaterally.

**Video Prompt:**
> A fit athlete performs a one-hand kettlebell deadlift with their right hand. ¾ front-angle camera, full-body shot. The kettlebell sits on the floor slightly inside the right foot. The athlete hinges at the hips with a flat back, grips the handle with one hand, and stands tall. The free left arm extends slightly to the side for balance. The torso stays square. They lower the bell back to the floor with control. Seamless loop. Clean background, even lighting. 5 seconds, one full rep.

---

### 1.5 Single-Leg Deadlift

**Definition:** A unilateral balance and hinge exercise. Standing on one leg, the athlete hinges forward at the hip while the non-standing leg extends straight behind them, creating a "T" shape. One or both hands grip the kettlebell as it lowers toward the floor. This develops posterior chain strength, hip stability, and proprioception.

**Video Prompt:**
> A fit athlete performs a single-leg kettlebell deadlift standing on their left leg, holding the kettlebell in the right hand. Side-angle camera, full-body framing. The athlete hinges forward at the hip, extending the right leg straight behind them as a counterbalance, lowering the kettlebell toward the floor. The back stays flat and the body forms a "T" shape at the bottom. They return to standing with control. Seamless loop. Clean gym background, even lighting. 10 seconds, two full reps.

---

### 1.6 Dead-Stop Swing

**Definition:** A swing variation where the kettlebell comes to a complete rest on the floor between every repetition, eliminating the stretch-shortening cycle. The athlete must generate full power from a dead stop each rep, reinforcing proper hip hinge mechanics and explosive force production without relying on momentum.

**Video Prompt:**
> A fit athlete performs a dead-stop kettlebell swing. ¾ front-angle camera, full-body shot. The kettlebell starts on the floor. The athlete hinges, grips the bell, and hikes it back between the legs before driving the hips forward to swing it to chest height. The bell swings back down and the athlete places it on the floor, pausing briefly before the next rep. Distinct pause on the floor between reps. Clean gym background, even lighting. Seamless loop. 5 seconds, one full rep.

---

### 1.7 Alternating Swings

**Definition:** A one-hand swing in which the athlete switches hands at the top of each rep. At the apex of the swing, the bell is briefly weightless; the athlete releases one hand and catches with the other before the bell descends. This trains grip transitions, coordination, and bilateral power.

**Video Prompt:**
> A fit athlete performs alternating one-hand kettlebell swings. ¾ front-angle camera, full-body shot. The athlete swings the kettlebell up with the right hand. At the top of the arc, when the bell is momentarily weightless, they release the right hand and catch the handle with the left hand. The bell swings back between the legs and up again, switching hands at the top each rep. Smooth, fluid transitions. Seamless loop. 10 seconds, showing one full hand switch.

---

## 2 · SQUAT (4 Exercises)

### 2.1 Goblet Squat

**Definition:** The athlete holds the kettlebell by the horns (sides of the handle) or cradles the bell at chest height in a "goblet" position. They squat down by bending the knees and hips simultaneously, keeping the torso upright and elbows tracking inside the knees, then stand back up. This is an excellent beginner squat pattern that teaches depth and upright posture.

**Video Prompt:**
> A fit athlete performs a goblet squat holding a kettlebell at chest height by the horns. ¾ front-angle camera, full-body shot. The athlete stands with feet slightly wider than shoulder-width, squats down with an upright torso until the elbows touch the inside of the knees at the bottom, pauses briefly, and drives back up to standing. Controlled tempo, smooth motion. Clean gym background, even lighting. Seamless loop. 5 seconds, one full rep.

---

### 2.2 Front Rack Squat

**Definition:** The kettlebell is held in the "rack" position — the bell resting against the forearm and bicep, elbow tucked tight to the body, wrist straight. From this position the athlete performs a full squat. The offset load challenges core stability and thoracic extension. Can be performed with one or two kettlebells.

**Video Prompt:**
> A fit athlete performs a single-kettlebell front rack squat. ¾ front-angle camera, full-body shot. The kettlebell is held in the right-hand rack position — bell resting on the forearm, elbow tucked against the ribs. The athlete squats to full depth while keeping the torso upright and the rack position stable. They stand back up with control. The free arm extends slightly for balance. Seamless loop. Clean background, even lighting. 5 seconds, one full rep.

---

### 2.3 Goblet Lunge

**Definition:** Holding the kettlebell in the goblet position at the chest, the athlete steps one foot forward (or backward) and lowers the back knee toward the floor, creating 90-degree angles at both knees. They then push off the front foot to return to standing. This trains single-leg strength, balance, and hip flexibility.

**Video Prompt:**
> A fit athlete performs a goblet lunge holding a kettlebell at chest height. ¾ front-angle camera, full-body shot. The athlete steps forward with the right leg, lowering the left knee toward the floor while keeping the torso upright and the kettlebell stable at the chest. Both knees form approximately 90-degree angles at the bottom. They push off the front foot to return to the starting position. Smooth, controlled motion. Seamless loop. Clean gym background, even lighting. 5 seconds, one full rep.

---

### 2.4 Cossack Squat

**Definition:** A deep lateral squat. The athlete takes a wide stance and shifts their weight to one leg, squatting as deep as possible on that side while the opposite leg extends straight with the toes pointing up. The kettlebell is held in the goblet position for counterbalance. This builds hip mobility, adductor flexibility, and lateral stability.

**Video Prompt:**
> A fit athlete performs a Cossack squat holding a kettlebell in the goblet position. Front-angle camera, full-body shot. The athlete stands in a wide stance, shifts their weight to the right leg and sinks into a deep single-leg squat on that side. The left leg extends straight out to the side with the toes pointed up. The torso stays upright with the bell held at the chest for counterbalance. They push back up to center. Seamless loop. Clean background, even lighting. 5 seconds, one full rep.

---

## 3 · PRESS (3 Exercises)

### 3.1 Strict Press

**Definition:** Starting with the kettlebell in the rack position, the athlete presses the bell straight overhead to full lockout using only shoulder and arm strength — no leg drive or momentum. The wrist stays neutral, the elbow locks out at the top, and the core braces to prevent the spine from arching.

**Video Prompt:**
> A fit athlete performs a strict kettlebell press with the right arm. ¾ front-angle camera, upper-body and full-body framing. The kettlebell starts in the rack position on the right side. The athlete presses the bell straight overhead to full arm lockout with no leg drive or body lean. They pause briefly at the top with the bicep near the ear, then lower the bell back to the rack position with control. Seamless loop. Clean gym background, even lighting. 4 seconds, one full rep.

---

### 3.2 Push Press

**Definition:** Similar to the strict press, but the athlete uses a short, sharp dip-and-drive of the legs to generate upward momentum, helping to "launch" the kettlebell overhead. The legs dip a few inches, then extend explosively, transferring force through the torso to the arm. This allows pressing heavier loads than the strict press.

**Video Prompt:**
> A fit athlete performs a kettlebell push press with the right arm. ¾ front-angle camera, full-body shot. The kettlebell starts in the rack position. The athlete performs a quick, shallow knee dip, then explosively extends the legs to drive the kettlebell overhead to lockout. The legs straighten and the arm finishes the press at the top. They lower the bell back to the rack with control. Seamless loop. Clean gym background, even lighting. 4 seconds, one full rep.

---

### 3.3 Bottoms-Up Press

**Definition:** An advanced press variation where the kettlebell is held upside down — the bottom of the bell faces the ceiling and the handle points downward, gripped tightly. The athlete presses this inverted bell overhead. The unstable load demands extreme grip strength, forearm activation, and shoulder stabilizer engagement.

**Video Prompt:**
> A fit athlete performs a bottoms-up kettlebell press with the right arm. ¾ front-angle camera, full-body shot. The athlete holds a kettlebell upside down at shoulder height — the bottom of the bell faces the ceiling, gripped tightly by the handle. They press the inverted bell overhead to lockout with visible effort to keep the bell balanced and stable. The arm shakes slightly from the instability. They lower it back to shoulder height with control. Seamless loop. Clean background, even lighting. 5 seconds, one full rep.

---

## 4 · PULL (5 Exercises)

### 4.1 Clean

**Definition:** A swing-to-rack transition. The kettlebell is swung from between the legs (like a one-hand swing) but instead of floating forward, the athlete redirects it by pulling the elbow back and "zipping up" the bell into the rack position on the chest. The bell should land softly on the forearm without banging. It combines hip power with a precise arm path.

**Video Prompt:**
> A fit athlete performs a kettlebell clean with the right arm. ¾ front-angle camera, full-body shot. The kettlebell starts between the legs. The athlete hikes the bell back, drives the hips forward, and as the bell rises, pulls the elbow back and guides the bell smoothly into the rack position on the right side of the chest. The bell lands softly against the forearm without banging. They lower the bell back between the legs to repeat. Seamless loop. Clean gym background, even lighting. 4 seconds, one full rep.

---

### 4.2 Snatch

**Definition:** The most dynamic single-arm kettlebell movement. In one fluid motion, the bell travels from between the legs to a fully locked-out overhead position. The athlete swings the bell upward, and as it reaches head height, punches the hand through the handle so the bell rotates smoothly over the wrist and lands gently on the back of the forearm overhead. The hip drive does the heavy lifting.

**Video Prompt:**
> A fit athlete performs a kettlebell snatch with the right arm. ¾ front-angle camera, full-body shot. The kettlebell starts between the legs. The athlete hikes the bell back, explosively drives the hips, and the bell accelerates upward in a close arc along the body. As it passes head height, the athlete punches the hand through the handle and the bell rotates smoothly over the wrist to land gently on the back of the forearm with the arm fully locked out overhead. They lower the bell back down in a controlled arc. Seamless loop. Clean background, even lighting. 5 seconds, one full rep.

---

### 4.3 Single-Arm Row

**Definition:** A bent-over pulling exercise. The athlete hinges at the hips, braces the core, and rows the kettlebell from a hanging arm position up to the ribcage, driving the elbow back. The non-working hand can rest on the knee or a bench for support. This targets the lats, rhomboids, and rear delts unilaterally.

**Video Prompt:**
> A fit athlete performs a single-arm kettlebell row with the right arm. Side-angle camera, upper body and torso framing. The athlete is hinged forward at the hips with a flat back, left hand resting on the left knee for support. They pull the kettlebell from a full arm hang straight up to the right ribcage, driving the elbow back and squeezing the shoulder blade. They lower the bell back down with control. Seamless loop. Clean gym background, even lighting. 4 seconds, one full rep.

---

### 4.4 Bent-Over Row

**Definition:** A bilateral version of the row. The athlete hinges forward with a flat back, holding a kettlebell in each hand (or one bell with both hands). Both bells are rowed simultaneously to the ribcage, emphasizing the upper back, lats, and posterior shoulders. The hip hinge position also trains isometric posterior chain endurance.

**Video Prompt:**
> A fit athlete performs a bent-over kettlebell row holding two kettlebells. ¾ front-angle camera, full-body shot. The athlete is hinged forward at the hips with a flat back, arms hanging with a kettlebell in each hand. They row both kettlebells simultaneously up to the ribcage, squeezing the shoulder blades together at the top, then lower both bells with control. Seamless loop. Clean gym background, even lighting. 4 seconds, one full rep.

---

### 4.5 High Pull

**Definition:** A swing-height pull. The athlete performs a one-hand swing, but at the top of the arc, pulls the elbow back and up so the hand comes to chin or face height — similar to an upright row powered by the hips. The elbow stays above the hand at the peak. It serves as a progression between the swing and the snatch.

**Video Prompt:**
> A fit athlete performs a kettlebell high pull with the right arm. ¾ front-angle camera, full-body shot. The athlete hikes the kettlebell back between the legs, drives the hips forward, and as the bell rises, pulls the elbow back and up so the hand reaches chin height. The elbow stays above the hand at the peak, like an explosive upright row. The bell is then guided back down between the legs. Seamless loop. Clean gym background, even lighting. 4 seconds, one full rep.

---

## 5 · CARRY (4 Exercises)

### 5.1 Turkish Get-Up (TGU)

**Definition:** A slow, deliberate full-body movement in which the athlete moves from lying flat on the floor to standing upright — all while holding a kettlebell locked out overhead with one arm. The sequence passes through multiple positions (supine, elbow, hand, bridge, kneeling, lunge, standing) and is reversed to return to the floor. It develops total-body stability, mobility, and coordination.

**Video Prompt:**
> A fit athlete performs a Turkish Get-Up with a kettlebell in the right hand. ¾ front-angle camera, full-body shot. Starting flat on their back with the right arm extended and the kettlebell locked out overhead, the athlete transitions through each phase: rolling to the elbow, posting on the hand, bridging the hips, sweeping the leg to a kneeling position, and standing up tall — the kettlebell stays locked out overhead throughout. Time-lapse or sped-up motion to fit the full sequence into a loop. Clean gym background, even lighting. 6 seconds, one full get-up from floor to standing.

---

### 5.2 Suitcase Carry

**Definition:** The athlete holds a single kettlebell at their side — like carrying a suitcase — and walks with an upright posture. The asymmetric load forces the core, particularly the obliques and quadratus lumborum, to work hard to prevent the torso from leaning toward the weight. A simple but highly effective anti-lateral-flexion exercise.

**Video Prompt:**
> A fit athlete performs a suitcase carry holding a kettlebell in the right hand at their side. ¾ front-angle camera, full-body tracking shot or treadmill walk. The athlete walks forward with a tall, upright posture — shoulders level, torso not leaning toward the bell. The kettlebell hangs naturally at arm's length beside the right hip. Steps are steady and controlled. Seamless loop. Clean gym background, even lighting. 4 seconds of continuous walking.

---

### 5.3 Rack Walk

**Definition:** The athlete holds one or two kettlebells in the rack position (bell resting on the forearm, elbow tucked) and walks. This challenges anterior core stability, shoulder endurance, and thoracic posture under a sustained load. Breathing becomes a skill as the bell compresses the chest.

**Video Prompt:**
> A fit athlete performs a rack walk holding a kettlebell in the right-hand rack position — bell resting on the forearm, elbow tucked to the ribs. ¾ front-angle camera, full-body tracking shot or treadmill walk. The athlete walks forward with an upright posture, keeping the bell stable in the rack. Steps are steady and deliberate. The free left arm swings naturally. Seamless loop. Clean gym background, even lighting. 4 seconds of continuous walking.

---

### 5.4 Farmers Walk

**Definition:** The athlete holds a kettlebell in each hand at their sides and walks with a strong, upright posture. This bilateral carry builds total-body strength, grip endurance, trap and upper-back engagement, and core stability. It is one of the simplest yet most effective loaded carry variations.

**Video Prompt:**
> A fit athlete performs a farmers walk holding a kettlebell in each hand at their sides. ¾ front-angle camera, full-body tracking shot or treadmill walk. The athlete walks forward with a tall, strong posture — chest up, shoulders back and down, arms straight. The kettlebells hang at arm's length beside each hip. Steps are steady and powerful. Seamless loop. Clean gym background, even lighting. 4 seconds of continuous walking.

---

## 6 · MOBILITY (4 Exercises)

### 6.1 Goblet Halo

**Definition:** Holding the kettlebell upside down by the horns at chest height, the athlete slowly circles the bell around their head in a smooth orbit — passing behind the neck and back to the front. This mobilizes the shoulders, thoracic spine, and wrists while engaging the core. The path should be tight and controlled, keeping the bell close to the head.

**Video Prompt:**
> A fit athlete performs a goblet halo with a kettlebell held upside down by the horns at chest height. Front-angle camera, waist-up framing. The athlete slowly circles the kettlebell around their head in a smooth, tight orbit — moving the bell to the right, behind the head, around to the left, and back to the front of the chest. The head stays still and the core is braced. Slow, controlled motion. Seamless loop. Clean gym background, even lighting. 4 seconds, one full orbit.

---

### 6.2 Windmill

**Definition:** An advanced mobility and stability exercise. The athlete presses or holds a kettlebell overhead with one arm locked out, then slowly hinges laterally and downward by pushing the hip out under the bell and rotating the torso, reaching the free hand toward the floor. The overhead arm stays vertical throughout. This deeply stretches the hamstrings and obliques while demanding shoulder stability.

**Video Prompt:**
> A fit athlete performs a kettlebell windmill with the right arm locked out overhead holding a kettlebell. Front-angle camera, full-body shot. The athlete shifts the right hip out to the side and slowly hinges the torso down and to the left, reaching the left hand down the left leg toward the floor. The right arm stays vertical with the kettlebell locked out overhead, eyes on the bell. They return to standing with control. Seamless loop. Clean gym background, even lighting. 6 seconds, one full rep.

---

### 6.3 Figure-8 Pass

**Definition:** A dynamic coordination drill. Standing in a wide stance with a slight squat, the athlete passes the kettlebell in a figure-8 pattern — weaving the bell between and around the legs. One hand passes to the other behind one leg, then the bell travels forward and is passed behind the other leg. This trains grip transitions, hand-eye coordination, and active hip mobility.

**Video Prompt:**
> A fit athlete performs a kettlebell figure-8 pass. Front-angle camera, full-body shot. The athlete stands in a wide stance with a slight squat. They pass the kettlebell from the right hand through the legs to the left hand behind the left leg, then swing the bell forward and around the left leg, passing it through the legs to the right hand behind the right leg — tracing a figure-8 pattern. The motion is fluid and rhythmic. Seamless loop. Clean gym background, even lighting. 4 seconds, one full figure-8.

---

### 6.4 Around the World

**Definition:** A simple rotational pass. The athlete stands upright and passes the kettlebell around their waist in a circular path, switching hands at the front and back. This warms up the grip, shoulders, and core with gentle rotational loading. Often used as a warm-up or active recovery drill.

**Video Prompt:**
> A fit athlete performs a kettlebell around-the-world pass. Front-angle camera, waist-up framing. The athlete stands tall and passes the kettlebell around their waist in a smooth circular path — the right hand passes the bell behind the back to the left hand, which brings it around the front, and the cycle continues. Fluid, rhythmic motion with minimal body sway. Seamless loop. Clean gym background, even lighting. 4 seconds, one full orbit.

---

## 7 · COMPOUND (2 Exercises)

### 7.1 Thruster

**Definition:** A combination of a front squat and an overhead press performed as one fluid movement. The athlete holds the kettlebell(s) in the rack or goblet position, squats to full depth, and on the way up uses the upward momentum from the legs to drive the bell directly into an overhead press. The squat and press merge into one explosive movement with no pause between them.

**Video Prompt:**
> A fit athlete performs a kettlebell thruster with a single kettlebell in the right-hand rack position. ¾ front-angle camera, full-body shot. The athlete squats to full depth with the bell in the rack position, then explosively stands and, without pausing, uses the leg drive to press the bell overhead to full lockout in one continuous motion. They lower the bell back to the rack and descend into the next squat. Seamless loop. Clean gym background, even lighting. 5 seconds, one full rep.

---

### 7.2 Clean + Squat + Press

**Definition:** A three-movement complex performed in sequence without putting the bell down. The athlete cleans the kettlebell from the floor to the rack position, then performs a front squat, and upon standing presses the bell overhead. This chains hip power, leg strength, and pressing strength into a single demanding sequence.

**Video Prompt:**
> A fit athlete performs a kettlebell clean, squat, and press complex with the right arm. ¾ front-angle camera, full-body shot. The athlete cleans the kettlebell from between the legs into the rack position. From the rack, they squat to full depth and stand back up. Upon standing, they press the kettlebell overhead to full lockout. They lower the bell back to the rack and then back down between the legs. Three distinct movements flowing together. Seamless loop. Clean gym background, even lighting. 6 seconds, one full complex.

---

## 8 · CORE (1 Exercise)

### 8.1 Plank (Optional with Bell)

**Definition:** A static hold in which the athlete supports their body in a straight line from head to heels, supported on the forearms (or hands) and toes. The entire core — abs, obliques, lower back, glutes — braces to maintain a rigid body position. Optionally, one or both hands grip a kettlebell handle for an elevated or unstable surface, or a pull-through variation can be added where the athlete drags a kettlebell from one side to the other beneath the body.

**Video Prompt:**
> A fit athlete performs a plank hold with hands gripping the handles of two kettlebells on the floor. ¾ front-angle camera, full-body shot. The athlete holds a rigid plank position — body in a straight line from head to heels, arms extended, hands gripping the kettlebell handles. The core is visibly braced, with no sagging or piking. A subtle breathing rhythm is visible. Seamless loop showing the static hold with slight natural micro-movements. Clean gym background, even lighting. 4 seconds, continuous hold.
