# Session background videos

Place exercise videos here. The session screen uses them as the background when that exercise is active.

**Naming:** `videos/<exercise-id>.mp4` (e.g. `swing-2h.mp4`).

**Two-Hand Deadlift:** use **`Two-Hand-Deadlift.mp4`** (the app maps `deadlift-2h` to this file).

Add your `Two-Hand-Deadlift.mp4` (or any other `<exercise-id>.mp4`) in this folder for the video to show.
